# Afrivon Connect

\*\*1. Project Name:\*\* Afrivon Connect

$\star { \star } 2$ .Core Concept:\*\*

A professional networking and community app serving as the social "heart" of the Afrivon Tech ecosystem. It is designed to foster connections, knowledge sharing,and community among African tradespeople and professionals.

$\star \star _ { 3 }$ . Strategic Role in Ecosystem:\*\*

\*\*\*Build Order:\*\* 7th. This app is to be built after the core ecosystem platforms (TradeLink, Learning Hub, etc.) have achieved a significant and active user base. A communication app is only valuable when there is a community to communicate with.

\*\*\*Primary Function:\*\*To be the ultimate retention tool. By enabling users to build a valuable professional network and feel part of a community, it creates a powerful "moat" that makes the ecosystem incredibly "sticky" and difficult to leave.
